# Week 4

first week where I have a decent organisational structure. I dunno if having a whole separate project for each week is overkill, but that's what I've decided to do for now.

lesson 1: learning to use markdown. going to try and start working in rstudio, taking notes with markdown and keeping everything linked to github etc

lesson 2: types of data science project

lesson 3: experimental design
