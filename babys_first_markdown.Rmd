# Notes on markdown

headers are done using # and then a space, with one being the biggest header, and then they get sequentially smaller when you add more.

*italics* are done with one set of asterks, **bold** is done with two.

# Header level 1
## Header level 2
### Header level 3

code is included by three backticks followed by {r} and then including your code chunk on a new line, and closed by andother three backticks after. but its easier just to use the insert code bit in the interface? theres also supposed to be a hotkey but it wasnt workign for me (not sure if thats cos cloud or keytext)


```{r}
print("hello world")
```

bullet points are just a dash and then a space, and at the end of the line make sure to incl two spaces

- logs  
- hogs

I'm going to try and upload the really badly formatted (ironic) markdown cheatsheet from this lesson to the repo so its nearby, but I don't really know how to do that. maybe straight from github?

I've left the default examples below.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
